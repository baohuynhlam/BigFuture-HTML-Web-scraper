We are planning to resume face-to-face learning on our campuses this fall. We continue to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Ohio Department of Health and regional and local health care partners to comply with directives and guidelines to safeguard our students, faculty, staff and visitors and reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 on our campuses. The strong partnerships we have developed with local health officials, hospitals, government and first responders will continue to be leveraged to mitigate the spread of the virus and create a safe environment for students, faculty and staff to return to in the fall. Planning to resume face-to-face in the fall will mean that our University will be different. We will balance the interactions that make a residential campus like ours so valuable with a priority of creating a safe environment. We will institute social distancing protocols and health monitoring. Dining facilities will change how they serve food and accommodate seating. Classrooms, facilities and residence halls will be frequently sanitized and monitored. We are committed to taking these actions and others to prioritize your health and safety. While it is our plan to resume face-to-face in the fall, we would comply with any state restrictions and let science and the expertise of health officials guide our decisions","Financial Aid
