Therefore, the institution will be as flexible as possible throughout the entire admission process. We will not penalize any student who was unable to participate in something due to the pandemic. We have always performed a holistic admission review, so this year we will be particularly sensitive to academic impacts and will consider each individuals situation and context.","Financial Aid
