Other Characteristics
This is the 95th Anniversary of Albertus Magnus College.  This milestone speaks directly to the Albertus legacy which dates back to 1925 and the bold vision of the Dominican Sisters who answered a call of need, embraced that need, and brought forward New Englands first Catholic, residential liberal arts college for women  who might not otherwise have had access to an education of such quality and distinctiveness.  More than nine decades later, our Dominican mission continues to inspire the life-elevating education offered today to women and men, younger and older, diverse in the heritage and life experiences  all reaching out to us on campus and online.","Financial Aid
