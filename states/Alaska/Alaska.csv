Like many other IHEs, UAF moved to entirely online following mid-March 2020 Spring break. Summer 2020 classes are online. UAF hopes to resume in person classes for Fall 2020. although doing so depends on COVID-19 rates. The triple storm of COVID-19, low oil prices and state funding cutbacks has led UAF to innovate in ways not previously envisioned and it is aggressively expanding offerings of online course and academic programs. Nevertheless, whether on-line or in-person, UAF will welcome new and returning students in late August, 2020.","Financial Aid
