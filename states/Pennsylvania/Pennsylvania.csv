Other Characteristics
The Admissions Committee at Waynesburg University understands that high school students have not had access to sit for the SAT/ACT tests for several months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, weve heard concerns that access to future tests might be limited based on regional pandemic response. To alleviate those concerns, we have temporarily expanded our holistic application review for applicants unable to sit for the SAT/ACT due to COVID-19. This means that applicants can receive an admission decision and consideration for scholarships without the submission of test scores for the Spring and Fall 2021 semesters. 

Please note, applicants are strongly encouraged to submit test scores when available, as this may result in an increased scholarship award. The University is pleased to offer this temporary amendment to our policy for applications received through this calendar year, at which time we plan to reassess the impact of COVID-19 on testing availability.","Financial Aid
