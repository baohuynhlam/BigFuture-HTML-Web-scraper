National Louis University is committed to the health, safety, and well-being of our community while also ensuring an engaging academic experience for all of our students. As an institution experienced with online education and using technology to strengthen instruction, NLU has continued classes uninterrupted since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, instruction shifted to be fully remote, with most classes meeting during their normally scheduled times over videoconference, and all student support services such as tutoring, counseling, financial aid, career advising, and co-curricular activities continuing virtually. NLU plans to begin the Fall 2020 term with most classes continuing to be offered remotely, with in-person courses limited to those requiring face-to-face interaction, such as classes that require access to a lab or kitchen, or that have an experiential component. In addition, NLU is planning optional, low-density, and socially distant on-campus support and engagement activities that will be made available for students interested in participating in face-to-face programming. Designated computer labs and quiet study spaces will also be made available for students who desire a place to study and work. At all times, NLUs re-opening plans and safety protocols will be aligned with Illinois and Florida state guidance.",Financial Aid,No information,No information,"General Applying Information
