Due to the current public health crisis throughout the country and the world, MCLA is waiving the SAT/ACT testing requirement for first-year applicants for fall 2021 and fall 2022. While we will continue to accept and review any exam scores submitted, it will not be required for the next two years and students who do not submit scores will not be penalized. Additionally, MCLA will continue to award merit based scholarships to new students solely based on recalculated GPAs. This policy will go into effect for all applicants, including U.S. citizens and international students, first-year applicants and transfers, and students attending public and private schools and homeschooled applicants.

Test Optional for the 2020-2021 Application Cycle: Students applying to Williams as first-years or transfers during the 2020-2021 admission cycle have the option of applying under a test-optional policy. This change has been instituted for the upcoming admission cycle only, in response to the extraordinary challenges facing all of us during the COVID-19 pandemic. For students who choose to submit ACT or SAT results, those results will be considered as part of our holistic admission process that strives to center students and their unique lived experiences. Additional Flexibility in the Admission Process: We understand that the pandemic has led to school closings, shifts to remote learning and pass/fail grading policies, cancellations of co-curricular activities, and a host of other disruptions that dramatically impact what you envisioned for your school experience. You can be certain that well be flexible in working with you and your school counselor no matter what challenges or limitations youve faced. None of us know what the next few months will hold, but our commitment to getting to know you and your story will remain at the core of everything we do. Helping You Navigate Changing Financial Circumstances: Your familys financial picture may look very different today than it did a month ago or what it will look like six months from now. Our Quick Cost Estimator is a simple way for your family to monitor how your financial aid might change in turn. Be in touch with questions along the way and rest assured that moments of economic uncertainty are when we at Williams reassert our longstanding commitment to college access and affordability.","Financial Aid
